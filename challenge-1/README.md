Challenge - I
We want to automate the deployment of mediawiki on docker/K8/OpenShift, we’d like to see code file.
We want to assess your learnability and your current knowledge of containerizing an application using
an orchestration platform like K8/OpenShift.
Details
    we’ll start with one instance of mediawiki running.
    That’ll be backed by a database server (MySQL/Postgres) running on a separate container.
    We expect this to be installed using these steps: Installing MediaWiki
Expectations:
    • Automated setup for the problem statement including the infrastructure setup using any IAC code
      (Terraform/Azure ARM Template/AWS CloudFormation/GCP) of your choice
    • Adopt best practices in the tools which you are using. For example- Proper syntax and naming,
      Modular code etc.
    • We expect your solution to be designed using orchestration tool of your choice e.g., OpenShift,
      Kubernetes (Use Any Hyperscaler PaaS)
    • Brownie points if the application is running.
